* Agenda

- timing of this meeting
- starter grants ("bestuursakkoord")
- sector grants ("sektor gelden")
- criteria for decision after 1.5 years
- impact vs. research criteria
- Job Market in January
- TSB vacancy sector grants in our dept.

* Timing

- developments go quickly now
- still some things we do not know yet
- but we need to start preparing for the JM

* starter grants

- 5 year positions as assistant prof.
- tenure decision after 1.5 years
- our TT criteria apply for promotion after 5 years
- these positions have their own research money
- will be needed to reduce teaching load to current TT teaching load levels
- for new people in 2023
- /probably/ for some TT colleagues in 2022

* sector grants

- do not yet exist for economics
- are focused on inter-disciplinary research and impact
- TSB wants to collaborate with our dept. on one position (digital health)

* what do we need to do now?

- committee to develop criteria for tenure after 1.5 years
  - JM candidates need to know this when they apply for the position
  - unlikely to be based on research output
  - suggestion: citizenship and outreach/impact
- if we front-load some criteria to 1.5 years, perhaps reduce some criteria for promotion after 5 years

* TSB position

- initial interviews are done now
- if there are successful candidates, virtual flyout with a week or two

* Other things?
