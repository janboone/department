* Summary

- paper analyzes whether higher levels of cost sharing increase risk solidarity and welfare for people with high health risks
- risk classes defined on the basis of last year's expenditure
- model follows each insured per month over a year
- state variable: remaining deductible
- with some probability patient needs care (conditional on last month's care)
- there is a "true" need $\lambda$ and optional need $\omega$ if care is free
- insured take into account that spending now makes care "cheaper" in the future
- 


* disclaimer

- I am biased: we tend to find smaller effects
- read the paper with the view: what explains the different outcomes in the approaches


* what I like about the paper
- focus on risk solidarity
- explicitly distinguish different risk classes
- dynamic optimization problem taking remaining deductible into account
  - solution by backward induction
- model choices based on 2 principles
- intuitive figures to illustrate model fit


* things I do not quite get
** analysis
- paper suggests 0-1 decision on $\omega$, but there is a margin here as well:
  - e.g. $\omega=80$ remaining deductible equals 79 vs 1 euro remaining
- expenditure is defined as "aggregate payments for claims in each month, based on the date claims were initiated."
  - does this over-estimate $p^1$ if I get, drugs, in one month and physiotherapy in the next as part of the same treatment for tennis elbow?
- moral hazard is modeled as additive
  - seems counterintuitive: the more you (really) need, the more you can add
  - multiplicative seems sensible?

| risk             |  Q1 |  Q2 |  Q3 |  Q4 |
|------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----|
| exp $c$ if $c>0$ | 177 | 164 | 184 | 259 |
| $\omega$              |  87 |  71 |  73 |  17 |

- model does not allow for $c < \lambda$
- $\delta$ is higher for higher risk scores
  - but higher probability of dying?
- 

** more broadly
- paper basically argues that everybody gains if we increase the deductible level; even high risks:
  - so why do we have this discussion in the Netherlands?
  - which part of the analysis do people overlook?
- paper argues that risk aversion or liquidity constraints cannot overturn these results
  - but these arguments come back in the policy debate?
