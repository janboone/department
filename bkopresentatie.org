* competition policy

+ 3rd year Bsc course
+ usually about 40 students, but last year 80
+ we do not know yet how many students to expect in the Spring
+ [[http://janboone.github.io/competition_policy_and_regulation/][link to course material]]


* learning activities

+ video lectures
+ [[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science][datacamp]]: on line computer assisted learning for students to practice python programming
+ in class we go over a python file where we simulate the market activities that are relevant for that week's material (e.g. a merger)
+ this allows students to ask questions about the (video) lecture
+ for each class students prepare questions from previous exams
+ students preparation of these questions/participation in class is graded

* challenges

+ last year with 80 students it became hard to grade students' class participation
+ we have about 10 classes where we can grade activities, it seems reasonable that students want to have at least 2 grades
+ but giving 16 students per class the possibility to say something...
+ last we year we improvised using google forms; but this is not ideal
