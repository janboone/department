Task allocation
====================

bins vs continuous model
------------------------

* we propose to have a relatively simple 3 bin model that we will apply using common sense
* bin for research intensive profile is for people who satisfy tenure criteria in the past 5 years
* final numbers need to be calibrated; but even research intensive bin involves teaching and admin (in total 4 course equivalents)
* teaching profile has more teaching and admin
* intermediate profile
* we need to improve teaching efficiency to keep this manageable

    * video lectures
    * reduce MSc econ
	* combine RM and MSc courses
	* use external/part-time teachers

------------

* external money: we would like to encourage you to do relatively small projects

    * reduces teaching/thesis supervision (5000; 10,000; 15,000)
    * should we make this "mandatory"?

* but you cannot just reduce teaching below 2 courses by earning a lot
* if you want to do a big project, first talk to HoDs

* PhD supervision

    * we would like to come to a more uniform distribution of CentER PhD students over faculty
    * supervising a CentER PhD student counts as 2 MSc theses
	* keep an eye on the costs of the pre and formal defense (see dept. website for details)


Research budgets
======================

past, present, future
--------------------

* people have accumulated research budgets in the past, that we cannot afford to spend at the moment
* apologies for this ...
* if you want to spend more than 1500 per year from your personal research budget, ask HoDs first
* for expenditures below 1500, check with Korine first
* with external projects you can --at max.-- add 3000 euro per year to your research budget
* if you do not have a PRB, you can ask HoDs to spend at max. 1500 euro per year as part of dept. research budget
* once our budget improves, we can relax these rules


computer, laptop
----------------

* When your computer needs to replaced due to depreciation (4-5 years) or malfunctioning
* department will provide "standard" desktop/laptop (see ICT website; cost approx. 700-800 euro in 2016)
* if you prefer an upgraded model, the extra cost will be charged to your personal budget

submission fees
---------------

* Per year the dept. reimburses at max. 1500 euro in submission fees. Costs above 1500 euro will be charged to your personal budget
* membership fees are not reimbursed unless necessary for submissions
* we do not reimburse subscription fees for journals, magazines
* books need to be ordered via `INDEX Books <https://www.indexbooks.nl/>`_
* we can only reimburse books that are directly relevant for teaching purposes
* again, once the financial situation improves we can relax these rules



Summarizing
===============

What do you think?
------------------

* we like to hear your views
* we will adjust the document taking your views into account
* hope to finalize this before the summer
