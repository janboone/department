* Introduction

** Motivation

+ Dutch ministry of health worries about the level and growth of healthcare expenditures in basic insurance
+ one instrument to contain expenditures is demand side cost sharing
+ currently we have a mandatory deductible in the Netherlands (385 euroes)
+ trade off demand side cost-sharing:
  + lower expenditures
  + higher out-of-pocket for people with low health status
+ can we find a /form/ of demand side cost sharing which alleviates this trade off?

* forms of cost sharing

+ popular with Dutch policy makers:
  + deductible
  + co-payment (say 25%)
  + "donut"
+ CPB is supposed to "predict" healthcare expenditures under different schemes

** Research question

+ what are the effects of different cost-sharing /schemes/ on healthcare spending?
+ difficulty: after the reform, the Netherlands has only featured deductible (like) cost sharing
+ so we can estimate an equation like $y_{it} = ... + \alpha D_t + \varepsilon_{it}$
+ but this equation cannot determine the effect of a 25% co-payment

** Method

+ use Bayesian estimation techniques to determine distributions of healtcare costs (per age-gender category)
+ determine (expected) out-of-pocket payment (OOP) for each category
+ determine the effect of the OOP on healthcare expenditures
+ then for each /scheme/ we determine the OOP and then expenditures

** Why Bayesian?

+ distributions of healthcare spending are important for cost-sharing schemes
+ "standard" econometrics is based on sampling variation
  + but we have data on the whole population
+ we want policy recommendations like:
  + there is 60% probability that a deductible of 500 euro reduces expenditures by at least 10% (compared to 350 euro)
+ Bayesian approach can easily work with distributions
+ it is fun!
