** general idea

- The School committee is thinking along the following lines:
  - next to research track (as we have currently) a /complete/ teaching track will be introduced
  - tenure and promotion on teaching track will be at least as hard as on the research track


** major/minor

- criteria for tenure/promotion on both tracks are split into a "major" and a "minor":
  - major: research and teaching (at least one is "excellent", the other is "very good")
  - minor: outreach/impact and leadership (excellence in at least one of these)
- the School committee is still working on the details of the criteria to evaluate excellence in teaching, outreach and leadership
- as the committee is still working on this, your feedback is welcome!



* Department committee report on impact

** considerations

- outreach as public good/externality/internality
- opportunity cost of outreach and potential reputation loss if done badly
- outreach should be clearly linked to domain knowledge based on research
- take into account that outreach is easier for Dutch colleagues in the Netherlands
- evaluate outreach on a case-by-case basis

** implementation

- tie outreach to AIS score to emphasize link between outreach and research
- earn half a star with excellent outreach (independent from AIS)


* Other things

- anything you want to add?
