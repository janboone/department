* regulation

+ key to understanding regulation is:

    - differential impact of regulation instruments
    - on different types of firms

* measuring competition

+ if the market is competitive, less reason to "worry" for a competition authority

  + concentration measures
  + price cost margins
  + profit levels
  + "misinterpret" a firm that becomes more efficient

* health care

+ health care market is "complicated" due to combination of externalities
+ and the regulation to address these externalities
  + adverse selection; for basic package
    + mandatory insurance
    + community rating
    + insurers have to accept each customer
    + risk adjustment
  + moral hazard; for patients
    + deductible
  + moral hazard; for physicians
    + physicians as employees
    + insurers use budgets instead of fee-for-service
    + complicates risk adjustment
  + quality
    + hard to measure, report, contract on
    + look for observable variables correlated with quality; e.g. quantity
    + if we believe that patients can learn from each other, reward quality
      through quantity; but then: physician moral hazard

** provider competition

+ as patients are insured, this hardly happens on price
+ if patients can learn from each other, this happens on quality
  + "good quality"
    + better focus on patient well-being
    + easier to make appointments; combine appointments with different
      physicians on the same day
    + quicker recovery
  + "bad quality"
    + easier to get treatment
    + socially wasteful treatments (e.g. too expensive through upcoding)
+ providers only compete for patients, if they can make a profit on patients
+ depends on contracts offered by insurers

** insurer competition

+ insurers compete on how generous their contracts are compared to their price/premium
  + more generous contracts
    + make it more likely that patient gets treated
    + make it more profitable to attract patients through quality
+ adverse selection: if risk adjustment is not perfect, insurer does not want to
  be too attractive for patients with expected high costs
  + disadvantage of community rating: this is hidden through services offered
  + with risk rating this would be observable through prices
+ patients may not understand the value of a new treatment compared to current
  best alternative
  + too early adoption at a high price of new treatments


* value of sustainablity


+ ideally, sustainability is priced in the market
  + e.g. carbon tax (lack of sustainability)
  + consumer preference (valuation) for sustainable production, e.g. through certification
+ if so, competition will take care of it
  + firms' incentives to reduce costs will be socially valuable
+ this is the regulation solution to external effects
+ if it is not priced into the market:
  + competition may not maximize welfare:
  + coal is cheaper than solar energy and consumers prefer to pay low price
  + this does not imply that lack of competition (e.g. merger or agreements
    between firms) will improve sustainability

** tradeoffs

+ suppose we can "invest" now to get more a more sustainable outcome, will this
  be worth it?
  + e.g. we allow a joint venture which risks helping firms to coordinate prices as well
+ cost-benefit analysis
+ if we know the cost of the investment, what is the benefit of sustainability?
+ what is the value of a reduction in, say, global warming?
  + scientific input
  + this benefit cannot be "infinity"
+ how do we discount the future value?
  + interest rate
  + weight of population then vs now
  + probability problem will be solved otherwise
