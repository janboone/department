* announcements


* proposal sponsored chairs

- note that there is a university procedure for the appointment of prof. on sponsored chairs
- we cannot deviate from this procedure
- [[https://economics-department.netlify.com/proposals.html][the proposal found here]] is "only" a set of guidelines for a colleague of our dept. who is asked to join the committee appointing the chair ("BAC")
  - are these guidelines ok? Are things missing/should things be changed?


* how the dept. is financed

- there have been questions whether we should supervise theses for other dept.'s or teach courses for programs outside TiSEM
- we will elaborate on how the dept. is financed and why we think this is a good idea

* any other business
