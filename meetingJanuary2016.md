Underlying idea
====================

Extended stars-document
-----------------------

* based on reports by committees
* department meetings in the fall
* input from our sounding board
* discussions with numerous department members

------------

* synchronize tenure/promotion-incentives with task allocation incentives
* make explicit (unpleasant) choices to get budget in order
* 



Hiring
========

experience till now
-------------------

* the current hiring process follows the suggested procedure
* last week, we voted using web forms
* does the procedure work well?



Tenure and promotion
===========================

stars of excellence
-------------------

* stars were adjusted following suggestions made by the HR committee:

    * standing committee of three
    * colleagues at or above level to which candidate wants promotion vote
	* equal opportunities: should we be more specific?
	* how strongly should we focus on research for

        * tenure
        * promotion
        * "correction" for research time? productivity vs output?

    * create temporary/permanent/part-time positions for lecturers?


AIS
---

* we use CentER top 10 journal list (as does TiSEM)
* in addition, we propose to add journals with AIS $\geq 2$
* for tenure and assoc. prof., typically:

    * at least one paper in journal with AIS $\geq 2$
    * total AIS $\geq 6$

* for promotion to prof 2 and 1, we lengthen the period and increase the required productivity
* some journals (in and outside economics) have "funny" high AIS: decide on case by case basis?


good citizenship
----------------

* attend the Tuesday and Wednesday seminars
* respond timely to emails
* in the appraisal interviews, we take the view of the relevant "stakeholders" into account



Task allocation
====================

bins vs continuous model
------------------------

* we propose to have a relatively simple 3 bin model that we will apply using common sense





Research budgets
======================

past, present, future
--------------------

* people have accumulated research budgets in the past, that we cannot afford to spend at the moment
* apologies for this ...
