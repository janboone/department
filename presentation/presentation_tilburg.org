* Introduction

** Introduction

+ objective:
  + calculate effects of different cost-sharing schemes on healthcare spending
+ difficulties: 
  + after the reform, the Netherlands has only featured deductible (like) cost sharing
  + empirical literature too specific 
  + theoretical models hard to estimate
+ our aim is to develop a model which solves both points

** Why Bayesian?

+ distributions of healthcare spending are important for cost-sharing schemes
  + simulation should also cover e.g. a "donut"
+ "standard" econometrics works with sampling variation
  + but we have data on the whole population
+ we want policy recommendations like:
  + there is 60% probability that a deductible of 500 euro reduces expenditures by at least 10% (compared to 350 euro)
+ Bayesian approach can easily work with distributions

* Model

** Total healthcare expenditure in a year
+ $H(z)$: distribution of healthcare expenditure in a year
  + where $z=x+y$
  + $x$: exogenous, not affected by cost-sharing, high-value care
     + if you break your leg, you get "plastered up"
  + $y$: endogenous, affected by cost-sharing
     + if you have a running injury, perhaps you skip the physiotherapy
 
** Idea of the model
+ "at the start of the year", person $i$ is offered one $y$ treatment with value $v_y$ and expected out-of-pocket cost $OOP$
+ $i$ accepts if $v_y$ exceeds expected $OOP$

+ $OOP$ depends on:
  + $f(x)$ ex-ante distribution of exogenous healthcare expenditure
  + $g(y)$ cost distribution of offered treatment $y$
  + cost-sharing scheme
+ for a deductible $D$, $OOP$ equals $\int_0^{+\infty} \int_0^{+\infty} (\min\{x+y,D\}-\min\{x,D\})f(x)g(y)dxdy$
 
* Estimation

** Parametric specification
+ "everybody knows" that healthcare expenditures are log-normally distributed:
  + log transformation of positive healthcare costs are normally distributed
  + we model the propability on zero healthcare costs
  + benefits of log-normal distribution:
    + analytical expression for $OOP$ with deductible (estimation)
    + analytical expression for distribution of $x+y$

** Example

#+name: fig:TwoDistributions

** Four components
+ define categories age by gender (current model: $38*2$) 
  + each category has a /distribution/ of (log) healthcare costs $z$
+ distribution is mixture of 4 components:
  + $x \sim N(\mu_x,\sigma_x)$, with age and year FE by gender 
  + same for $y$
  + $\psi$ is probability treatment is offered ($x > 0$), with age FE by gender (and year FE women 21+) 
  + $\phi$ is same for $y > 0$
  + people in each category know their $\psi,\phi$ and their distributions of $x,y$
+ calculate $OOP_y$ per age, gender, year with $x,y,\psi,D$
+ compute probability $F$ that $y$ is rejected ($v_y < OOP$)
  + $v_y \sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ by age and gender

** Probabilities

+ calculate probability for each mixture component

| component | probability                 |
| $x=y=0$   | $(1-\psi)(1-\phi + \phi F)$ |
| $x>0=y$   | $\psi*(1-\phi + \phi F)$    |
| $y>0=x$   | $(1-\psi)\phi(1-F)$         |
| $x,y>0$   | $\psi \phi (1-F)$           |

** Technique

+ specify priors for parameters:
  + 5,000,000 observations per year
  + on average 65,000 observations per category per year
+ estimation with variational inference (ADVI, Auto-diff Variational Inference) and minibatches
  + standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (Metropolis, NUTS etc.) do not scale well with data size
+ python and pymc3 fun to work with
  + parameter $\phi$ has age and gender fixed effects:
   ~ϕ = pm.Deterministic('ϕ', phi[age,sex])~
+ for each age-gender category, we draw 10,000 samples of the model parameters
+ for each sample we draw one $x,y$ and $z$


* Fit

** How to measure fit

+ not obvious how to measure the fit of the model
+ we can compare: 
  + average expenditure per age-gender category (fit vs observed) 
  + distributions via QQ plots
  + predicted vs realized zero-expenditures per category (but what is "zero"?)

** Fit on average costs by age, year and sex

* Where do we stand

+ estimation "works" and goes quite fast
+ model needs to be fine-tuned
  + e.g. distribution parameters for $x$ vary around 18
+ simulations work as well
+ simulations slow down when working with 10,000 samples and simulated OOP
