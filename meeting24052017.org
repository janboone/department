* announcements

+ 100% BKO
+ planned date to move to P: 19 and 20 July
+ we've started the appraisal interviews
  + if you have feedback for us feel free to give this
  + we will also create a webform to give feedback
+ next dept. meeting: June 13
  + with drinks afterwards
  + we can simply have drinks, or you can organize something
+ things we are thinking about at the moment:
  + criteria for sponsored chairs
  + next year's thesis allocation
  + talk to us if you have ideas about these


* Renovation: corridors

+ apologies for the confusion here
+ question is: how many "formal" and "informal" meeting rooms would you like to have
+ this is another example of decision under uncertainty

* tenure and promotion procedure

+ we have the new procedure now for over a year
+ we promised to review it after a year
+ we want to collect your ideas
+ if you want to change things, you can make proposals and we vote on them


** positive feedback we received

 + we have clear procedure now
 + it is democratic
 + AIS scores seem more reasonable than narrowly defined Center-journal-lists
   + do we use the right benchmark values? Should they be higher/lower?



** concerns

 + the speed of the procedure
   + both a dept. procedure and one at TiSEM
 + effort investment by committee
   + one suggestion: perhaps there are cases where the committee does not need to read papers
 + (mis)match between dept. and faculty procedure
   + both in terms of criteria and procedure
 + how should we deal with external money being brought in?
   + count as AIS points? Good citizenship?
 + the way we evaluate education: we have not yet received proposals on this.


** criteria academic directors

 + people who do not satisfy the standard tenure/promotion criteria
   + e.g. anyone with a major admin task
   + like academic directors
 + we have tried to create ex ante criteria
   + like every year of AD counts as $x$ AIS points
   + but we didn't manage
 + our suggestions is to have a personal plan for people that do not satisfy the standard tenure/promotion criteria
 + but then we need to be able to commit to AD's about tenure and promotion
 + we will have a dept. meeting in which we explain our decision and you can ask questions but there will not be a vote

* any other business

+ other things we need to discuss (on next meeting)
