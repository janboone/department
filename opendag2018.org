* Introduction

** two definitions

+ Economics analyzes the allocation of scarce resources
+ Economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing
+ both are relevant in health care
+ "financial considerations should play no role in health care"

** Dutch healthcare system

+ mandatory insurance
+ private insurers
+ government determines treatments in basic package
+ insurers have to accept everyone
+ everyone above 18 faces a mandatory deductible


** why worry?

** value

+ growth does not mean anything (good or bad)
+ value is important
+ is there reason to believe we lose value in health care?

** expenditure vs age

** examples

+ proton beam therapy

#+REVEAL: split

+ strong preference for treatment (even if it does not do much) than to do nothing
+ end of life care

    + most people prefer to die at home surrounded by loved ones
    + many end up in a hospital bed, filled with tubes and attached to machines
	+ until the age of 70, costs in last year approx. 17.000 euro

+ why does this happen?


* Health insurance

** moral hazard

+ we have (mandatory) health insurance because

    + treatments are expensive and you may not be able to afford them
    + if you could afford the treatments, big reduction in "normal" consumption
    + solidarity: some people are unlucky with their health and we all pay for their treatments

+ problem is that health becomes (almost) free

** solutions

+ exclude some treatments

+ higher copayment

  + insurance: people are risk averse
  + solidarity: chronically ill have to pay more

* Economic analysis

** scarce resources

+ we can spend each euro only once
+ should we spend it on education, welfare benefits, the army, health care, consumption (lower taxes)?
+ return on education is estimated to be around 15% per euro
+ what is the return on health care expenditure?
+ within health: if we face a budget, which treatments should we spend money on?

** value of health

+ suppose a treatment increases your life with exactly one year
+ what is this worth to you?

#+REVEAL: split

+ in the Netherlands we work with 80,000 euro per life-year
+ the UK with 25,000 pound
+ economic analysis finds something in the range 100,000-200,000
+ we are trying here to allocate scarce resources optimally and need to know the return on this spending to make the trade offs
+ but: Economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing


** not perfect health

+ there is a difference between a year of full health
+ and a year lying in hospital
+ or losing eye-sight
+ not being able to do your own shopping, walking the stairs
+ based on surveys, the 80,000 is discounted to take such effects into account
+ then we get qaly's: quality adjusted life years

** which treatment?

+ by this reasoning

    + a new cancer treatment that brings 0.5 qaly
    + at the price of 50.000 euro per treatment
	+ should not be covered by basic insurance
    + because, once it is covered, people will use it

+ this is what (almost) happened to the treatments for Fabry and Pompe
+ then the 8 o'clock news opens with ...


** difficult choices


+ should a 90 year old's qaly be valued the same as an 20 year old?

    + no, valued less: decreasing marginal returns and the 90 year old already had many years
    + no, valued more: 90 year old has only few years left; the additional qaly is a big increase

+ in the Netherlands, the analysis is not done at the patient level but at the treatment level
+ average increase in qaly's is used to decide wether to cover treatment or not


** Other effects

+ if we would be "more generous" and use 150.000 euro per qaly:

    + more treatments can be covered
    + seriously ill people do not have to buy expensive treatments themselves
    + either more money is spent on health care (and not education, welfare, development aid)
	+ or less money is spent on other treatments that have a higher return

        + then the physician her/him self has to decide who gets treatment and who not

    + pharmaceutical firms that have a monopoly (patent) on the drugs raise their price


** deductible

+ [[https://www.cpb.nl/publicatie/de-vormgeving-van-eigen-betalingen-in-de-zorg-maakt-uit][CPB]] finds that an increase in the deductible with one euro, reduces health care expenditure per head with 44 cent
+ how can they know?

* Conclusion

** policy implications

+ allocating scarce resources leads to "unpleasant" choices
+ economics makes these choices explicit
+ this gives the impression that "we know the price of everything and the value of nothing"
+ but if we do not make these choices as a society, physicians have to do it individually

    + very unpleasant for them
    + whether you get a life saving treatment or not, depends on your physician
	+ may not be equipped to trade off treatment against money spent on education

+ "financial considerations should play no role in health care"

    + not a great strategy 
    + by definition not true: once you decide to spend your euro on a treatment, you do not spend it on something else


** economics courses

+ to fully understand the discussion above, we need the analysis of

    + public economics

        + how should the government allocate money

    + micro economics

        + how does a health insurance market work with asymmetric information
        + moral hazard; adverse selection

    + industrial organization

        + how do pharmaceutical companies set their prices?

    + health economics (MSc)

        + how to determine the value of a qaly?
