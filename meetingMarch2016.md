  	* task allocation

Previous meeting
======================

productivity
------------

* in yearly appraisal interviews, we add the question:

    * "how much time for research did you have last year and how much should you have next year"

* this and other information about task mix are stored on the form
* tenure and promotion committee will ask HoDs for this information to get an estimate of candidate's research productivity
* the committee discloses this information along with its recommendation to the department



tenure criteria
---------------

* research

    * make tenure harder (AIS of at least 7 or 8 and 1 "top" journal) but subsequent step easier than in current proposal
    * how to deal with co-authors? Our proposal: $AIS \sqrt{2}/\sqrt{n}$
	* relation with AIS-cap: first correct for co-authors, then apply cap

* education

    * in principle, focus is on research
    * but we recognize that there can be exceptions due to excellent
      service to the department in the area of education
	* we will mention this explicitly in the document
    * hard to make concrete; leave the judgement to the tenure/promotion committee


------------

* voting for tenure/promotion

    * use webforms
    * if someone deviates from committee's proposal, needs to motivate
    * do we allow the tenure/promotion committee to disregard "no" votes that are badly motivated?


Task allocation
====================

bins vs continuous model
------------------------

* we propose to have a relatively simple 3 bin model that we will apply using common sense
* bin for research intensive profile is for people who satisfy tenure criteria in the past 5 years
* final numbers need to be calibrated; but even research intensive bin
  involves teaching and admin (in total 4 course equivalents)
* teaching profile has more teaching and admin
* intermediate profile
* we need to improve teaching efficiency to keep this manageable

    * video lectures
    * reduce MSc econ
	* combine RM and MSc courses
	* use external/part-time teachers

------------

* external money: we would like to encourage you to do relatively small projects

    * reduces teaching/thesis supervision (5000; 10,000; 15,000)
    * should we make this "mandatory"?

* but you cannot just reduce teaching below 2 courses by earning a lot
* if you want to do a big project, first talk to HoDs

* PhD supervision

    * we would like to come to a more uniform distribution of CentER PhD students over faculty
    * supervising a CentER PhD student counts as 2 MSc theses
	* keep an eye on the costs of the pre and formal defense





Research budgets
======================

past, present, future
--------------------

* people have accumulated research budgets in the past, that we cannot afford to spend at the moment
* apologies for this ...
* if you want to spend more than 1500 per year from your personal research budget, ask HoDs first
* for expenditures below 1500, check with Korine first
* with external projects you can --at max.-- add 3000 euro per year to
  your research budget
* if you do not have a PRB, you can ask HoDs to spend at max. 1500 euro per year as part of dept. research budget
* once our budget improves, we can relax these rules


Summarizing
===============

What do you think?
------------------

* we like to hear your views
* we will adjust the document taking your views into account
* hope to finalize this before the summer
