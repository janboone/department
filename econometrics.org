* Introduction

** Caveats

+ not meant as critique on econometrics teachers from our or other departments
+ I will exaggerate (a lot)

** Is there a problem?

+ figure with average population size per municipality
+ from students Msc and Bsc theses:
  + "the p-value is bigger than 0.05, so it is not true"
  + "the p-value is less than 0.05, hence the probability than the null-hypothesis is true, is less than 5%"
+ positioning of our program:
  + we teach our students statistics/econometrics as Econometrics students with a math-deficiency
  + goal is that they are able to read papers:
    + does not mean we have to teach it this way
    + 95% of our students will never read papers
+ even stuff that they do know, they don't recognize
+ students loose track of the "big picture":
  + what is the size of the effect?
  + quantify the uncertainty around this
  + perhaps you want to test a hypothesis



** Proposed solution

+ We should teach:
  + simulation based statistics/econometrics: then they know what they are doing
  + Bayesian statistics
  + data science type methods

* "standard" statistics is counter-intuitive

+ 

* Bayesian statistics

** "unfair" question

+ if we do "frequentist" statistics, is there uncertainty over the parameters?

** natural policy question

+ you run a regression like $y = \alpha + \beta x$ where $x$ is a policy variable that can be raised at a cost
+ only beneficial to raise $x$ if $\beta \geq 1$
+ "what is the probability that $\beta \geq 1$?"

** Why now?

+ If Bayesian statistics is so great, why only use it now?
+ "frequentist" statistics won the 20th century because it is analytically tractable
+ but we have computers now and great software to do Bayesian analysis

** advantages

+ teaching Bayesian statistics helps to explain the "frequentist" approach
+ helps our students to give more helpful answers in "real life situations"
+ is easier to explain to colleagues without a statistical background

* Data science

+ A major advantage of "big data" methods is that they are "bluntly" intuitive
  + split data in "training" and "testing" data
  + you estimate your parameters on the training data and see how well your predictions perform on the testing data
  + you wonder whether your results are specific to this training-testing split; let's do this a 100 times to see how sensitive it is
