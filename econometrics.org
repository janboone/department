* Introduction

** Caveats

+ not meant as critique on econometrics teachers from our or other departments
+ I will exaggerate (a lot)
+ points I want to make:
  + we teach the same statistics/econometrics and in the same way for the past 20 years
  + we may want to change this

** Is there a problem?

+ many students do not learn/remember what we teach them

[[./health_munic_size.png]]

+ from students Msc and Bsc theses:
  + "the p-value is bigger than 0.05, so it is not true"
  + "the p-value is less than 0.05, hence the probability than the null-hypothesis is true, is less than 5%"

** Marketing

+ positioning of our program:
  + we teach our students statistics/econometrics as Econometrics students with a math-deficiency
  + goal is that they are able to read papers:
    + does not mean we have to teach it this way
    + 95% of our students will never read papers


** Proposed solution

+ We should teach:
  + simulation based statistics/econometrics: then they know what they are doing
  + Bayesian statistics
  + some data science type methods

** Trade offs

+ but then we need to drop other things, like:
  + IV
  + two stages least squares
  + heteroskedasticity
+ we need to know whether this would cause problems for your courses

* Why is there a problem?

+ as our discipline has embraced "frequentist" statistics decades ago, we do not know any better
+ we may grumble a bit about referees' focus on t and p values, but we are used to this way of thinking
+ this is different for our students and especially to their future colleagues in a non-academic environment
+ as many of our students do not fully understand what they do, they cannot communicate their results to colleagues without a statistical background
+ they end up not using their statistical skills

** quick reminder

+ frequentists do $p(y|\theta)$
  + there is no uncertainty about $\theta$; we just do not know it
  + focus on $H_0: \theta=0$, but no one is interested in $\theta=0$
+ in a policy context:
  + you run a regression like $y = \alpha + \beta x$ where $x$ is a policy variable that can be raised at a cost
  + only beneficial to raise $x$ if we are pretty sure that $\beta \geq 1$
  + "what is the probability that $\beta \geq 1$?"
  + our student says "I found $b=0.5$ and it is not sign. different from 0"
  + "is it sign. different from 1?"
  + "no it is not"
  + "so now what?"
+ "frequentist" statistics won the 20th century because it is analytically tractable

** consequence of this

+ students tend to lose track of the "big picture":
  + what is the size of the effect?
  + quantify the uncertainty around this
  + perhaps you want to test a hypothesis
+ with simulation methods, we can focus on this
  + e.g. bootstrap from your data to get a sense of uncertainty
+ bootstrapping forces you to think about your hypothesis:
  + two samples $n_1,n_2$ with two different means $m_1 - m_2 > 0$
  + are the samples drawn from distributions with the same mean $\mu$?
  + how do you bootstrap?


* Bayesian statistics


** natural policy question

+ in policy it is often natural to think $p(\theta|y)$
+ Bayesian analysis allows you to do this
+ Bayesian answer is a distribution of $\theta$:
  + given the data and other things that we may know (prior), this is the uncertainty left about the population parameter of interest
  + how likely is it that $\theta > 10$?
+ this can be more easily explained to colleagues without a statistical background

** Why now?

+ If Bayesian statistics is so great, why only use it now?
+ the main disadvantage of this approach: not analytically solvable
+ but we have computers now and great software to do Bayesian analysis
+ our students are taught programming in R and python

** advantages

+ teaching Bayesian statistics helps to explain the "frequentist" approach
+ helps our students to give more helpful answers in "real life situations"
+ is easier to explain to colleagues without a statistical background

* Data science

** it is "hot"

+ big data are all over the news nowadays
+ but our students are not exposed to this
+ think of a job interview for our students:
  + "I can do 2sls" or
  + "I understand the algorithm that google uses for face recognition"

** it is easy to explain

+ A major advantage of "big data" methods is that they are "bluntly" intuitive
  + split data in "training" and "testing" data
  + you estimate your parameters on the training data and see how well your predictions perform on the testing data
  + you wonder whether your results are specific to this training-testing split; let's do this a 100 times to see how sensitive it is

+ prediction is more "intuitive" than statistical significance

* Discussion

+ should we keep our Bsc statistics/econometrics curriculum as it is?
+ if we would change it, do you expect problems for your courses?
+ are there other things that we should (not) teach them?
