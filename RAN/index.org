* Summary story
** standard story
- simple R&S model:
  - two risk types
  - $c_h > c_l$
  - perfect competition among insurers
  - community rating
  - distortions on low risk type contract


** Incentive Compatibility
- IC for high type is binding:
  - indifferent between own contract and cheaper low risk contract

** risk adjustment
- distortions reduced if expected costs are equalized
  - (ex ante) risk adjustment $\rho_i$
  - $c_h - \rho_h = c_l - \rho_l$
- equity/risk-solidarity increases as distortions are reduced
- high risk type is better off as distortion falls


** perfect risk adjustment
- with perfect risk adjustment: pooling outcome
  - no further gains from
    - community rating
    - mandatory pooling

** imperfect competition
- AND demand elasticities differ between risk types
- still distorted outcomes when cost differences disappear through risk adjustment
- to remove distortions:
  - maximize total welfare
  - overcompensate high risk types


** consumer welfare
- consumer (instead of total) welfare:
  - overcompensate low type
  - use competition leverage via IC constraint
  - limit insurers' instruments to differentiate contracts

* What problem do we worry about?

** R&S: perfect competition

** Ingredients of the model
- perfect competition: premium equals costs
  - $p_i = (c_i - \rho_i)q_i$ for $i=l,h$.
- high types value coverage more (at the margin) than low types
- by reducing coverage, a contract becomes relatively more attractive to low risk type


** Incentive Compatibility
- IC constraint high type is binding
  - intra-brand competition
  - high type is indifferent between buying her own contract and low type contract


** Effect risk adjustment
- zero profit lines $p_i = (c_i - \rho_i)q_i$ rotate toward each other
- $q_l$ increases: higher efficiency and welfare
- premium for high type is reduced: risk solidarity


** perfect risk adjustment
- in the limit with equal expected costs:
  - zero profit lines coincide
  - both risk types get efficient contract
  - both pay the same premium
  - $p = c_h - \rho_h = c_l - \rho_l$
  - insurers ignore IC constraints: independent markets


* What about demand side differences?

** Do demand differences exist?
- yes, but in which direction?
- some papers: higher health risks are less elastic:
  - people worry they will not be accepted by new insurer
  - fear of regret: "devil you know..."


** high risk is more elastic
- other papers: higher health risks are more elastic:
  - have more experience with healthcare system
  - better able to compare different insurance contracts
  - usually lower income: more willing to search for low premium


** Empirical research
- more research is needed:
  - predict elasticities of risk groups
  - not only expected costs
- to illustrate: high risks are less elastic w.r.t. new information
  - because they already know it?
- for concreteness: here we assume that high risk type is less elastic



** Insurer market power
- differences in elasticity have only an effect in case of insurer market power
- mark-up is higher on high risk market segment
- even if expected costs are equalized (perfect risk adjustment) elasticity differences cause distortions
  - think of mobile telephony
- firms distort contracts to separate the types


** Leverage
- competition leverage:
  - as risk adjustment towards high types increases
  - lower contribution to low types (balanced budget)
  - distortion is reduced
  - but less competition for low types
  - and $p_l$ increases and thereby (IC) increases $p_{h}$

* What is the effect on optimal risk adjustment?

** What is the objective
- no longer the case that
  - efficiency and
  - risk solidarity
  - go hand-in-hand


** Efficiency
- to avoid selection, insurers must be indifferent between attracting a low or high risk type
- over-compensate the high types to correct for differences in mark-ups
- if there are no selection effects, IC is not binding
- insurers offer both types the efficient contract at the same premium $p$


** Optimal mark-up
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\frac{p - (c_i-\rho_i)}{p} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{i}}
\end{equation}
- where $\varepsilon_l > \varepsilon_h$
- if $c_l - \rho_l = c_h - \rho_h$, this equation does not hold!
- can only be true if $\rho_h - \rho_l > c_h - c_l$.


** More weight on consumers
- new effect: let high types benefit from intense competition for low types via IC constraint
- starting from first best:
  - loss in efficiency is second order
  - price effect (leveraging competition) is first order
- under-compensate the high types
- subsidize the elastic low risk types


** Leverage
- fierce competition among insurers to capture profitable low types
- also benefits the high types via IC
- high types benefit even more if there is mandatory pooling
  - each insurer can only offer one contract
  - may reduce welfare if consumers differ on other dimensions (e.g. risk aversion)


* Summary
** Selection incentives
- to remove selection incentives in health insurance:
  - do not (just) focus on supply side (cost) differences
  - risk adjustment should take demand side differences into account as well


** Objective of risk adjustment
- what does planner want to achieve?
  - efficiency (total welfare)
  - redistribution from insurers to insured (consumer welfare)
- to get to an efficient outcome:  risk adjustment must overshoot cost differences


** Consumer welfare
- if government is biased towards consumers
- beneficial to stimulate price competition on the l-market:
  - increase $\rho_l$ and reduce $\rho_h$:
  - more intense l-competition reduces $p_l$ and via IC also $p_h$
  - high types benefit as well


** Market regulation
- competition leverage works better if insurers cannot escape competition by reducing $q_l$:
  - government sets coverage of basic package
  - puts limits on voluntary deductible
