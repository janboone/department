* Summary: approach

- paper analyzes whether higher levels of cost sharing increase risk solidarity and welfare for people with high health risks
- risk classes defined on the basis of last year's expenditure
- model follows each insured per month over a year
- state variable: remaining deductible
- with some probability patient needs care (conditional on last month's care)
- there is a "true" need $\lambda$ and optional need $\omega$ if care is free
- insured take into account that spending now makes care "cheaper" in the future
- estimated model is used to simulate/predict outcomes for different cost sharing schemes

* Summary: findings
- higher cost sharing than we currently have in the Netherlands reduces expenditure, premium and increases welfare, also for the high risks
- main effect is consumption reduction among low risk types

* Summary: disclaimer

- I am biased: we tend to find smaller effects
- read the paper with the view: what explains the different outcomes in the approaches


* what I like about the paper
- focus on risk solidarity
- explicitly distinguish different risk classes
- dynamic optimization problem taking remaining deductible into account
  - solution by backward induction
- model choices based on 2 principles
- intuitive figures to illustrate model fit
- model can be used to simulate outcomes for cost sharing schemes that were never implemented before


* things I do not quite get: analysis
- paper suggests 0-1 decision on $\omega$, but there is a margin here as well:
  - e.g. $\omega=80$ remaining deductible equals 79 vs 1 euro remaining
- expenditure is defined as "aggregate payments for claims in each month, based on the date claims were initiated."
  - does this over-estimate $p^1$?
  - if I get, drugs, in one month and physiotherapy in the next as part of the same treatment for tennis elbow?
- moral hazard is modeled as additive
  - seems counterintuitive: the more you (really) need, the more you can add
  - multiplicative seems sensible?


*  things I do not quite get: effect size
- table 5: Q1 halves expenditure from D=0 to D =350
  - halves it again to D=500
  - for higher quartiles effects are smaller
  - our findings suggest: Q1 hardly goes to the doctor and if they go it is something serious
 - oop expenditure falls as $D$ increases from 350 to 500 euro:
  - huge behavioral effect
  - for many people necessary expenditure is already above 500 euro?
- 75% coinsurance with 350 max. leads to higher oop than $D=350$?
  - in each state of the world you pay less


*  things I do not quite get: interpretation
| risk class      |  Q1 |  Q2 |  Q3 |  Q4 |
|-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----|
| $E(c \mid c>0$) | 177 | 164 | 184 | 259 |
| $\omega$             |  87 |  71 |  73 |  17 |

- once I fill my deductible, every following month (with probability $p^{0,1}$)  I will spend $\omega$
- small increase in $D$ that prevents healthy people from outspending $D$ early in the year has very big effect
- $\delta$ is higher for higher risk scores
  - but higher probability of dying?


*  things I do not quite get: robustness
- risk solidarity is more important than risk aversion
  - absurd level of risk aversion is needed to overturn results
  - but the Dutch...
- liquidity constraints/behavioral hazard
  - model does not allow for $c < \lambda$
    - hard to interpret arguments about unmet needs
    - model only captures not visiting a doctor when one has needs
    - not the fact that visit was made but under-spending $c < \lambda$.

*  things I do not quite get: more broadly
- paper basically argues that everybody gains if we increase the deductible level; even high risks:
  - so why do we have this discussion in the Netherlands?
  - which part of the analysis do people overlook?
- paper argues that risk aversion or liquidity constraints cannot overturn these results
  - but these arguments come back in the policy debate?
