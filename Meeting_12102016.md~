Financial Situation
===================

Forecast of results
-------------------

|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|510 |-19 |154 |-190|283 | 417|

* our reserve at the end of 2021: -1.168k
* we are moving in the right direction, but we are not there yet

teaching capacity 
-----------------

* we need to increase teaching capacity
* that is, not TT-hiring
* 0.1; 0.15 fte contracts to teach 1 course

    * we will have to teach more over the coming years
    * some people already mention that teaching and admin tasks seem
      "out of control"
    * this trend will continue
    * if we want to stick to the "bins", we need teaching capacity

* we are doing this already; but we need to do more here
* we need names of people that we can approach here.

TT job market
-------------

* in the past the strategy of the department was: if financially
  possible, go to the JM
* this strategy has advantages and disadvantages: a disadvantage we
  saw over a year ago
* if we want to say "your tenure decision does not depend on the
  financial situation of the dept.", we need to have the financial
  reserves to cover this
* although the numbers are moving in the right direction, there is
  still lots of uncertainty (e.g. student numbers) and in a couple of
  months time the situation can be very different
* if we do this, we need to decide on whether we want to specify a field

------

* pros of going to the JM this year:

    * our presence on the JM
    * keep momentum
    * hire a TT with new ideas for research

* cons

    * uncertainty over financial situation
    * we can end up in a situation again where people start to leave
      and we do not have the resources to stop this
    * if we wait one year, we may be able to recruit two TT's
    * may be easier to agree on a field

------

* if we decide to go to the junior JM, we do this within the [Philip
  Eijlander Diversity program](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/organization/working-at/gender-policy/ped.htm) 
* that is, we will be looking for a future female colleague
* we know the pros and cons of such an approach; we decided that
  gender balance is important enough to make a commitment here


senior hire
-----------

* an alternative --prefered by the HoDs-- is to wait another year
  before going to the JM
* if we can hire two TT's (at least) one of these two hires will be a female colleague
* in the meantime, we start recruitment for a senior hire in macro
  broadly defined (macro/public/labour)
* TiSEM is introducing a scheme to attract top researchers
* in competition with other departments, we can make a proposal for a
  top researcher in our department
* if our proposal is selected by TiSEM, they sponsor the position for
  3 years
* the probability to get the TiSEM sponsoring will be higher if we
  hire a female top researcher, but is not required


What do we choose?
------------------

* today we need to decide which option we choose:

    * either go to the JM this year
    * or focus on senior recruitment


MSc Economics
=============

Student numbers have increased
------------------------------

* Sjak has done a great job: the new program has increased the number
  of students
* this is great and we need to be careful changing the program
* but we do a lot of teaching compared to what we are paid for
* we can keep on doing this (but don't complain to your HoDs about
  your teaching load)
* or we may carefully try to reduce the number of courses or find
  overlap with the RM
* most departments use this overlap between MSc and RM; we don't
* any ideas are welcome here!
