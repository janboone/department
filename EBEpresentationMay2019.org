* Why choose the Economics track?

+ if you are interested in:
  + analysing the broader implications of things that happen
  + what are the effects of policy changes for aggregate groups:
    + society as a whole
    + municipality
    + consumers as a group
    + firms

** questions like

  + is taxation a good thing?
  + should we give tax breaks to attract companies to the Netherlands?
  + how should taxes be designed?
  + how should the stock market be regulated?
  + what are the effects of Brexit on trade?
  + what is the effect of a merger on consumers?
  + how should health care be organized?

* Economics vs Business

** merger

+ When Google and Facebook merge:
  + how can this be leveraged to raise profits?
    + marketing
    + finance
    + management
    + accounting
  + is this beneficial for society as a whole?
    + privacy
    + competition in hi-tech markets
    + stimulates or reduces innovation?
    + can a government still govern (say, tax) such a company?

** Brexit

+ When the UK leaves the EU:
  + what are the conequences for our firm?
    + can we still export at competitive prices to the UK?
    + should we source our inputs from UK or from Ireland?
    + is there an increased currency risk?
  + how should the Netherlands --as a country-- adapt:
    + should we try to attract firms/banks from London to Amsterdam?
    + will unemployment increase?
    + effects on inflation, interest rates, stock prices?


* two examples in health care

** hospitals that go bankrupt

*** primary physicians need to solve market problems?

* Questions you need to ask yourself

** on bankruptcy of a hospital

+ if a hospital is so popular with people, how can it go bankrupt?
+ what is the danger of keeping bad performing hospitals alive with subsidies from the ministry?
+ why is it a problem if a hospital in Amsterdam goes bankrupt?
+ how many patients needed to be moved from Slotervaart ziekenhuis after it went bankrupt?
+ why did it "suddenly" collapse?

** on design of a health care market

+ macro economic aspects of health care: in 20 years time, healthcare spending can be 30% of GDP
+ this is not necessarily bad; but it is a lot of money...
+ have you heard people talk about Albert Heijn needing "more money and less market"?
+ should healthcare be financed via taxation (only) like the NHS or via a health insurance premium as in the Netherlands?

** design (contnd)

+ one may have some sympathy for GP's: they save society a lot of money but do not get a percentage of these savings as "bonus"
+ in one of the interviews, someone remarks: "Het vraagt om een verschuiving van concurrentie- naar samenwerkingsmarkt"
+ they want agreements with other providers to "improve healthcare"; but this is called a cartel
+ cartels are illegal...
+ but cooperation between firms is actually possible and legal in "normal" markets as well
+ one needs to take into account the (European) rules of competition policy

* Courses that will help you answer these questions

+ competition policy: articles 101 and 102 on contracts between firms
+ industrial economics
+ micro economics
+ public economics
