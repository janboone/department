Introduction
================


Agenda

    * thesis allocation
	* video lectures

* document on 

    * hiring
    * tenure
	* task allocation
	* personal research budgets


Extended stars-document
===============================

Underlying idea
---------------

* based on reports by committees
* department meetings in the fall
* input from our sounding board
* discussions with numerous department members

------------

* synchronize tenure/promotion-incentives with task allocation incentives
* make explicit (unpleasant) choices to get budget in order




Hiring
========

experience till now
-------------------

* the current hiring process follows the suggested procedure
* last week, we voted using web forms
* does the procedure work well?



Tenure and promotion
===========================

stars of excellence
-------------------

* stars were adjusted following suggestions made by the HR committee:

    * standing committee of three
    * colleagues at or above level to which candidate wants promotion vote
	* equal opportunities: should we be more specific?
	* how strongly should we focus on research for

        * tenure
        * promotion
        * "correction" for research time? productivity vs output?

    * create temporary/permanent/part-time positions for lecturers?


AIS
---

* we use CentER top 10 journal list (as does TiSEM)
* in addition, we propose to add journals with AIS $\geq 2$
* for tenure and assoc. prof., typically:

    * at least one paper in journal with AIS $\geq 2$
    * total AIS $\geq 6$

* for promotion to prof 2 and 1, we lengthen the period and increase the required productivity
* some journals (in and outside economics) have "funny" high AIS: decide on case by case basis?


good citizenship
----------------

* attend the Tuesday and Wednesday seminars
* respond timely to emails from students and colleagues
* in the appraisal interviews, we take the view of the relevant "stakeholders" into account



Task allocation
====================

bins vs continuous model
------------------------

* we propose to have a relatively simple 3 bin model that we will apply using common sense
* bin for research intensive profile is for people who satisfy tenure criteria in the past 5 years
* final numbers need to be calibrated; but even research intensive bin involves teaching and admin
* teaching profile has more teaching and admin
* intermediate profile
* we need to improve teaching efficiency to keep this manageable

    * video lectures
    * reduce MSc econ
	* combine RM and MSc courses

------------

* external money: we would like to encourage you to do relatively small projects

    * reduces teaching (5000; 10,000; 15,000)
    * should we make this "mandatory"

* but you cannot just reduce teaching below 2 courses by earning a lot
* if you want to do a big project, first talk to HoDs

* PhD supervision

    * we would like to come to a more uniform distribution of CentER PhD students over faculty
    * supervising a CentER PhD student counts as 2 MSc theses
	* keep an eye on the costs of the pre and formal defense





Research budgets
======================

past, present, future
--------------------

* people have accumulated research budgets in the past, that we cannot afford to spend at the moment
* apologies for this ...
* if you want to spend more than 1500 per year from your personal research budget, ask HoDs first
* if you do not have a PRB, you can ask HoDs to spend at max. 1500 euro per year as part of dept. research budget
* once our budget improves, we can relax these rules


Summarizing
===============

What do you think?
------------------

* we like to hear your views
* we will adjust the document taking your views into account
* then this will become the basis for the appraisal interviews that we will start next month
