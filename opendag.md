Introduction
================

two definitions
---------------

* Economics analyzes the allocation of scarce resources
* Economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing
* both are relevant in health care

why worry?

value
-----

* growth does not mean anything (good or bad)
* value is important
* is there reason to believe we lose value in health care?

examples
--------

* proton beam therapy ![death star](http://img.lum.dolimg.com/v1/images/Death-Star-I-copy_36ad2500.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1600%2C900&width=300 "death star")
* strong preference for treatment (even if it does not do anything) than to do nothing
* end of life care

    * most people prefer to die at home surrounded by loved ones
    * many end up in a hospital bed, filled with tubes and attached to machines
	* until the age of 70, costs in last year approx. 17.000 euro

* why does this happen?


Health insurance
======================


moral hazard
------------

* we have (mandatory) health insurance because

    * treatments are expensive and you may not be able to afford them
    * solidarity: some people are unlucky with their health and we all pay for their treatments

* problem is that health becomes (almost) free
* when something is free, people tend to behave in "strange" ways


solutions
---------

* higher copayment

    * insurance: people are risk averse
    * solidarity: chronically ill have to pay more

* exclude some treatments
* in the news:

    * "Advies: borstkankermiddel niet vergoeden", NRC 21-1-2016
	* "Bestraling van kanker kan beter maar kost wel 10.000 euro meer", NRC 5-3-2015
    * "Longkankermedicijn is te duur voor basispakket, vindt Zorginstituut", NRC 8-12-2015
    * "Pompe wel of niet in het basispakket, dat is de vraag", NRC 22-9-2012
	* "Duur medicijn voor SLE-patient afgewezen voor vergoeding", NRC 11-9-2012

Economic analysis
=======================

scarce resources
----------------

* we can spend each euro only once
* should we spend it on education, welfare benefits, the army, health care, consumption (lower taxes)?
* return on education is estimated to be around 15%
* what is the return on health care expenditure?
* within health: if we face a budget, which treatments should we spend money on?

value of health
---------------

* suppose a treatment increases your life with exactly one year
* what is this worth to you?

--------

* in the Netherlands we work with 80.000 euro
* the UK with 25.000 pound
* economic analysis finds something in the range 100.000-200.000
* we are trying here to allocate scarce resources optimally and need to know the return on this spending to make the trade offs
* but: Economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing


not perfect health
------------------

* there is a difference between a year of full health
* and a year lying in hospital
* or losing eye-sight, hearing
* not being able to do your own shopping, walking the stairs
* based on surveys, the 80.000 is discounted to take such effects into account
* then we get qaly's: quality adjusted life years

which treatment covered?
------------------------

* by this reasoning

    * a new cancer treatment that leads to 0.5 qaly
    * at the price of 50.000 euro
	* should not be covered by basic insurance

* this is what (almost) happened to the treatments for Fabry and Pompe
* then the 8 o'clock news opens with ...


difficult choices
-----------------

* should an older person


Other effects
-------------

* if we would be "more generous" and use 150.000 euro per qaly:

    * more treatments can be covered
    * seriously ill people do not have to buy expensive treatments themselves
    * either more money is spent on health care (and not education, welfare, development aid)
	* or less money is spent on other treatments that have a higher return

        * then the physician her/him self has to decide who gets treatment and who not

    * pharmaceutical firms that have a monopoly (patent) on the drugs raise their price



Conclusion
=============

policy implications
-------------------

* allocating scarce resources leads to
